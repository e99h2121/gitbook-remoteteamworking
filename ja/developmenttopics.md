## Development topics

Gathered useful thinkings and links about development's each scenes in remote team working.

Author's note:

When I've worked with other teams who is working in geographically separated team, there was the problem I felt.

- The problem of the communication gap or frustration, especially caused by the lack of the English skill. I can accept (at least relatively) about not good at Speaking/Writing, but I cannot comprehend why you don't Read any English sentence of our mail? It is fundamental work which is completely same with to write your source code. If, you think its translation is the responsibility of Japanese member in Shanghai office, there may be huge gap between us. We need to think about alternative option. 

- Communication response is slow. Even if we send a message from Webmail2 Chat group, sometimes there is no response during several hours. Quick response, to react yes/no, positive/negative must be very essential business manner. I doubt, it is invading the fundamental principle of HRT. -> http://juristr.com/blog/2012/10/hrt-humility-respect-and-trust/

- Let's define Schedule and Due-date strictly, and let's keep it. Let's avoid to change them without any prior notice. 

- Let's avoid late hours meeting. Be in healthy working time. I cannot believe to wait till 9pm because of your personal matter. (Let's notice prior.)

- Of course, you should point out our behavior if you feel our behavior is wrong. Saying nothing cannot comprehend anything, especially among global communication. (Please, NO 空気を読め. It is wrong communication style of Japanese language.)
